# Week 4: Project 1 Work Week

## Today:
- Presentation
- Work on Project 1
  - Progress check-in
  - Individual meetings as needed

## Homework
- Finish Project 1!
Critique is next week. Come with everything you need for presenting your work in the way you envision. I.E. if you have prints that should go on the wall, bring thumb tacks.
We will have about 15-20 minutes for setup at the beginning of class, but everything must be FINISHED.
