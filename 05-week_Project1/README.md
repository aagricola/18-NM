"It matters that we pay attention to why Haiti struggles: it is like looking at a mirror. My photographic work from Haiti is my effort at trying to make sense of this complex dynamic. It is a narrative of disintegration and resuscitation, a traverse through a series of themes and lives. I have been visiting and working in Haiti since  January, 2006." -Pradip Malde

Photos of Haiti that reveal a sort of order and chaos.

"Yet, kindness, civility and charity are common; these are the quieter attitudes and tend to become drowned out by the attention given, both from within the nation and by the international press, to the more traumatic characteristics. ‘The Third Heaven’, acknowledges this quieter attitude. Photographs always resist complete explanations. The specifics and stories around a photograph beg for conversations, which provide the architecture for long-term understanding and vision of the future. This work reduces the distancing effect of pity by provoking conversations about another way of being and striving to be human; a way that returns to humility and harmony within a more natural order." - [Quote from Artist Statement - visit website for the full text](http://pradipmalde.com/2018/03/20/the-third-heaven-book/2018/)

"The Monument Quilt: a public healing space by and for survivors of rape and abuse. The Monument Quilt is an on-going collection of stories from survivors of rape and abuse. Written, stitched, and painted onto red fabric, our stories are displayed in city and town centers to create and demand public space to heal. The quilt resists the popular and narrow narrative of how sexual violence occurs by telling many stories, not one. The quilt builds a new culture where survivors are publicly supported, rather than publicly shamed." - [From the Website](https://themonumentquilt.org/about/)

FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture is an art activist effort to upset the dominant culture of rape, and promote a counter-culture of consent. FORCE was founded by Hannah Brancato and Rebecca Nagle in 2010 and is currently led by Saida Agostini, Shanti Flagg, and Hannah Brancato.

Adrienne Segal, "California Water Rights"

"Taking an interdisciplinary approach that integrates scientific research, data visualization, history, landscape, and materiality, I interpret the complex poetics of statistical information into highly crafted forms and materials that reveal trends, patterns, and changes in the landscape that occur over time." - [Adrienne Segal](https://www.adriensegal.com/statement)

"Strands of ball chain hang from a meandering metal river. Each strand represents 1,072 of the largest permitted water users in California. The length of each strand correlates to the amount of water each user holds the right to, and the color represents the type of entity. This permanent architectural installation in the atrium of an office building spans 3 floors. Each ball represents 1 acre-foot of water, or just under 326,000 gallons. There are over 11,000 feet of ball chain in the sculpture, conveying the immense amount of water allocated - greater than how much water is naturally available. The sculpture allows the viewer to directly experience and gain knowledge about the current water allocation system and to consider where our priorities as a society are in how we manage shared and precious resources."

### Dear Data

If you think you would like to do something that is a data visualization, check out this collaborative project that tracks daily activities between two pen pal designers, Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec. It is not highly technical, but it is very revealing of things that go unseen most days.

### Rachel Whiteread

There is a Rachel Whiteread retrospective up at the National Gallery! I highly encourage you to see it before it comes down January 13. It is also a perfect show to inspire you for this project!!

" Whiteread’s sculptures memorialize everyday objects, domestic interiors, and public spaces. Throughout her celebrated career, Whiteread has effectively recast the memories of these locations and objects to chart the seismic changes in how we live, from the late 20th century and into the 21st."

## Project 1

If nothing else, we have learned that one of art’s agreed upon purposes is to make visible the invisible, to shed light on something in the dark, to speak when there is silence. For project 1, create an object, series of images or collages, or installation that makes visible something invisible. Use at least two of the skills we learned in the first half of the semester.

Requirements:
- You must spend a minimum of three hours per week outside of class working on this project
- Write an Artist Statement to Accompany the work, print it, and bring it to the **Critique: OCT 22**

## Homework
- Work on Project 1 : Your progress will be evaluated next week and this is part of the project grade. Please ask me questions if you are confused or want to do something that maybe we have not yet learned. We will not have class next week due to FALL BREAK!! But that means you will still have that week to work on your project, so I expect to see around six hours worth of progress on whatever you are working on.
