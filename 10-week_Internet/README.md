## Identity

"What has identity become, now that our social selves are laid bare online?" How has the internet shaped your identity?

[Eva & Franco Mattes](http://0100101110101101.org/) "Riccardo Uncut"
"For Riccardo Uncut, artists Eva and Franco Mattes posted a call on social media, offering to buy someone's phone for $1,000 in order to turn the photo and video contents into an art project—an uncut and uncensored portrait of someone's life." - Whitney

## Community

[Computers Club](http://www.computersclub.org/club/)

"When anyone can connect with anyone and everyone shares the same framework to present themselves, such as Facebook, a certain democracy develops...Tumblrs, and online galleries and exhibitions being established to disseminate ideas and work. While these groups may extend themselves out of the Internet realm to execute IRL shows in physical galleries, the percentage that do are still relatively small as compared to the massive amounts of work created and distributed exclusively online."

[Krist Wood](http://www.kristwood.com/)

"Access to computers and the Internet completely changed the way that I consumed information and organized ideas in my head. I saw information stacked on top of itself in simultaneity, no longer confined to spatiotemporal dimensions of the book."

## Body
"The internet is a mirror which we gaze into to find new ways of identifying ourselves"

"What will happen to our bodies?" How do our devices and constant connection alter senses and the self?

## Games

"When our lives become unmanageable, we turn to whatever we can find to try and regain control. For some that is drug addiction, self-harm, or hurting others, but there are hundreds of millions of people who have found catharsis and control in games. "

[Jon Rafman, "Kool-Aid Man in Second Life Tour"](https://vimeo.com/4870055)

## Humanity

[Camille Henrot "Grosse Fatigue"](https://vimeo.com/86174818)
"Trying to com-prehend (to comprehend = to grasp) an infinite mass of information that, by definition, will forever remain in excess in the span of thirteen minutes is an exercise that falls within the bounds of what Walter Benjamin, using psychiatric terms, called a “cataloguing psychosis”. "

Claire L. Evans, [Digital Decay](https://vimeo.com/400918)

This quote is taken from Douglas Davis' essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction," which argues (in part) that unlike analogue signals, which are like waves crashing upon a beach and losing clarity with every ebb of the tide, digital bits "can be endlessly reproduced, without degradation, always the same, always perfect."

**How will our connections online deepen, our dependence and symbiosis continue to evolve?**

**"What happens when the power runs out, when we get disconnected?"**

## Project 2

Using any combination of skills learned in class, create something that emphasizes your experience of the global digital age. You can approach this from any number of angles; where are we presently, where are we headed, what are your fears or anxieties for the future? This is a very open ended project that is meant to give you freedom to explore a medium that was personally exciting to you, and one in which best communicates your conceptual idea.
