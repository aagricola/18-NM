## Poetic Computation

git config --global user.email aagricola@mica.edu

*"The main challenge is trying to create work that touches people at an emotional level, as opposed to them thinking about the technology or wondering how it was made. Making poems, not demos, is how we refer to it, i.e. making work that is like a poem, short yet dense, re-tellable, rhythmic, meaningful as opposed to a demo that just feels like technology for technology's sake. "*    -Zach Lieberman

["Messa di Voce" (Placing the Voice)](https://vimeo.com/2892576) is a collaborative performance and audio visuals by Golan Levin, Jaap Blonk, Joan La Barbara, Zach Lieberman

*"Code can be a source of inspiration and it can help create previously unimaginable forms."*   - Casey Reas & Chandler Mcwilliams

[Augmented Hand Series](http://www.flong.com/projects/augmented-hand-series/) is a real-time interactive software system that presents playful, dreamlike, and uncanny transformations of its visitors’ hands; by by Golan Levin, Chris Sugrue, and Kyle McDonald

### Why should I learn to code?

 - Learning to code allows you to build your very own tools instead of using someone else's
 - Gateway to realizing new forms
 - Learn to see systems in everyday life
 - Learn to code, less be coded:

 [Douglas Rushoff SXSW Lecture "Code or Be Coded"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imV3pPIUy1k)

### Why should I learn coding with Processing?

 - P5 and Processing are intuitive and visually responsive language to learn to code in
 - Learning through immediate visual feedback! (text in —> visuals out)
 - Processing is a fully functional programming language —> built on Java
 - FREE — Open Source (lots of online resources for learning)
 - Its simplicity is ideal for the beginners

[Download Processing from here](https://processing.org/download/)

*“A computer is nothing more than a machine that is brilliant at following precise instructions, but knows nothing about the world at large. And this is where we begin our journey, our story, our new life as a programmer. We begin with learning how to talk to our friend, the computer.”* -Daniel Shiffman

And we talk to the computer using coded instructions called an algorithm. It is nothing more than a detailed instruction. While the word algorithm is usually used in the realm of computers, you could call any precise explanation of how to do something an algorithm - a baking recipe, knitting instruction, driving directions, ect.

## In-class Assignment: Self Portrait

 Make a sketch of yourself using simple lines and shapes incorporating some details about you - hobbies, place of origin, favorite food, or whatever. Think in primitive shapes like the ones we learned in Processing. Then translate your drawing into code in Processing. It can be representational or somewhat spontaneous and abstract.

## Homework
- Reading from Form & Code located in resources folder at the top of today's post
