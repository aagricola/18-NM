## Project 2

Using any combination of skills learned in class, create something that emphasizes your experience of the global digital age. You can approach this from any number of angles; where are we presently, where are we headed, what are your fears or anxieties for the future? This is a very open ended project that is meant to give you freedom to explore a medium that was personally exciting to you, and one in which best communicates your conceptual idea.
